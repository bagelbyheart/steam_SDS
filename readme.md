# Steam Simple Dedicated Service (Tool)

A tool to simplify deployment of linux based dedicated servers using `steamcmd`
and `systemd`. The initial commit is just a script to launch Valheim and a
corresponding systemd unit file, but the goal is to have a script that generates
these two files instead.
